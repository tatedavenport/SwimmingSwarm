Instructions:
	Topside Computer
		Install blhelisuite 16 (ESC Flashing (test on linux at some point))
		Install QGroundcontrol
		How to install / run joystick over wifi	(have to install pygame)	


	Raspberry Pi
		Install OS / copy SD card
		Install dronekit (fix for python3 somehow??? maybe sudo pip3 install dronekit)
		Install pymavlink (order matters, version needs to be 2.2.10 instead of 2.0.6)

		Install GNURadio
		Install SoapySDR
		Install Osmocom
		Install Limesuite (don't forget to change the cmakelists or install gtkGui or whatever to get the GUI to build) (DownloadMoreRAM.com?)
	

	Pixhawk
		Make custom frame (in 6DOFMotors.cpp) :/
		Build Ardupilot (have to install arm-none-eabi-gcc)
		Flash firmware to pixhawk/run tests through groundcontrol

Troubleshooting:
	Raspberry Pi
		Won't connect to pixhawk when pi isn't getting high enough voltage in
	Pixhawk
		Sometimes won't connect to anything if not back-powered through the ESC's











Electrical:
	Maybe update schematic to include connectors
	Get diagram of plate/component layout?
