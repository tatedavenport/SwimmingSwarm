How to Compile the Pixy Library
Look at this lovely guide!
https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:building_libpixyusb_as_a_python_module_on_linux

If your system does not have Linux Mint installed like the guide assumes, follow these instructions:

If you have Arch and don't know, sorry, figure it out yourself.

If you're on a Mac:
First, make sure you have home-brew installed:
https://brew.sh/
For the first step in the compilation procedure ("Install dependencies for building Python SWIG module"):
You need to install each package individually, probably, and some of the names are different. So:
brew install swig
brew install libusb
brew install gcc
brew install git
Make sure you have the Xcode tools installed, according to a brief Google.

The rest of the instructions should work! For some reason it turns the command line green but uh don't worry about it.

Now, to be able to run our pixy files: Navigate to pixy2/build/python_demos. Move pixy.i, _pixy.so, swig.dat, and pixy.py into your working directory. You did it!
